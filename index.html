      <p>I study at Nova Pioneer. I am at year 5 and I have 2 sisters. I ❤ reading that sometimes I get out of time.My favourite book is stage school, Lily under pressure.I usually find reading a nice little adventure that you get to learn all sorts of things while having fun.My favourite subjects is science and Literature. In science, I expiriment what will happen when you do this and what will happen when you do that. In Literature, you learn new vocabulary words and also write a book!

      <h3>My hobbies.</h3>

      <p>One of my hobbies is to programme,especially at Udemy. When coding, you learn how computers work, how the internet works and many more. If you want to start programming, I suggest you start with the following:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://code.org/athome">Code.org</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://www.tynker.com/">Tynker</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12638830?start=0#content">Udemy</a></li>


</ul>
             <br>



    <p>Another of my hobbies is to play with my sisters, I feel bad for them when they don't have anyone to play with and plus, it's the right thing to do when you haves sisters. It is kind of fun to have sisters beacuse you can sing to them a lullaby when it's time to sleep, you can read them bed time stories and many more. You can even ask them to help you make a photo album of you and them. There so many activities you can do together. </p>
